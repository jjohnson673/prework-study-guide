# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This webpage was designed as a how-to practice design page. This allowed me to learn, practice and build off of the basic foundations of HTMLS, CSS, JavaScript and Github.

I was motivated to create this webpage to learn the basic functions and build a solid foundation to keep learning and pushing forward with my current career position.
